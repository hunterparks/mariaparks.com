                    <p>Hello! I am a special education teacher in Wisconsin. I have been blogging my journey in
                        education on and off since I graduated from college (go UW-Whitewater!) in 2018. I wanted to
                        take another, more serious stab, at it as the passion for what I am doing now, grows by the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you told me 3 years ago that I was going to be teaching: literacy, math, life skills, and the
                        occasional self contained elective, social studies, and science classes– I probably would have
                        laughed out of pure incredulousness. But, alas, here we are. </p>
                    <h3 id="how-do-myself-and-many-other-teachers-do-it">How do myself and many other teachers do it?
                    </h3>
                    <p>We get really good at learning from other teachers in our building and online. We become
                        masterful at finding free resources online, Teacher Pay Teachers becomes a go to resource, and
                        we do not stop until we find what will help our students learn what they need to know. </p>
                    <p>So, I figure I can do a small part and share to the teaching community a bit about what I am
                        doing in my classroom. Maybe someone out there will be able to use what I have created; which is
                        mostly videos at this point (I am a self proclaimed You-Tuber since the pandemic and virtual
                        learning hit). </p>
                    <p>I <strong>KNOW</strong> it feels like most days we do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> have enough
                        time to get everything done in a day– so if someone else can benefit from what I have done, then
                        why not share. </p>
                    <h3 id="what-my-videos-are-and-are-not-">What my videos are... and are not... </h3>
                    <p>By no means are my videos perfect. Do I mess up? Do I say "ummm" and "ope" sometimes? Do I have
                        the most ridiculous facial expressions <strong><em>MOST</em></strong> times? </p>
                    <p>YES. </p>
                    <p>YES. </p>
                    <p>and YES. </p>
                    <p>Just like everyone else in the world I am working on my craft and getting better by the day. Take
                        them or leave them for what they are. </p>
                    <h3 id="where-my-passion-lies">Where my passion lies</h3>
                    <p>Right now, my passion lies in life skills and pre-vocational skills. I think these are two of the
                        <strong><em>MOST</em></strong> important skills for the students I work with. I am having a
                        plethora of fun learning about these areas. You will see for now, my content is going to focus
                        on these areas. It is something that makes me happy, and who doesn't need a bright spot in these
                        WEIRD pandemic times we are in.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="let-s-review-">Let's review...</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>My name is Maria. </li>
                        <li>I am a special education teacher who is passionate about student success, life skills, and
                            pre- vocational skills. </li>
                        <li>I want to share what I am doing in hopes that others find it useful and can use it with
                            their students without having to re-create the wheel. </li>
                        <li> I want to help- help <em><strong>all</strong></em> people succeed. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Thats it in a nutshell. Come along and learn with me– I am by no means an expert, but I am
                        looking forward to sharing what I know and continue learning with the teaching community. </p>
