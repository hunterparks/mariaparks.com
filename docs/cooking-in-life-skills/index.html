                    <h3 id="cooking-in-school-pre-covid-">Cooking in School? (Pre-COVID) </h3>
                    <p>Although I know cooking in school, is not a crazy idea, especially with all of the
                        <em><strong>amazing</strong></em> Family and Consumer Education teachers out there (shout out to
                        the two amazing ladies at my school... you know who you are), but it might not be something you
                        think about doing with students with more intensive needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, I am here to tell you- Pre COVID times, cooking in my classroom was one of my
                        <em><strong>favorite</strong></em> things to do! Did it take a lot of time and was it a mess
                        most of the time?
                    </p>
                    <p>YES. </p>
                    <p>But, that was half of the fun! I will tell you the level of engagement of my kids
                        <strong>SKYROCKETED</strong> when we were cooking. I had kids sitting at a table for extended
                        periods of time with laser focus on the task at hand which was a <strong>BIG</strong> deal for
                        some of my kids.
                    </p>
                    <p>And, more importantly the kids were learning and practicing skills that might mean the difference
                        between <em>being able to make meals for themselves or depending on someone else to help them.
                             </em></p>
                    <h2 id="stop-">STOP. </h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Think about that... I had this realization earlier this year and it made me re-think a lot of
                        what I do because the things you work on now, can <em>impact the quality of life that students
                            may have long after they leave you. </em></p>
                    <p>SO... cooking it is! We had a toaster oven donated to us from a teacher who was getting rid of
                        one and we had a microwave in our room. The kids (and parents) helped brainstorm foods that the
                        kids liked to eat and we rotated through them. </p>
                    <h3 id="now-cooking-during-covid-">Now... Cooking During COVID...</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, is nonexistent. While cooking in my building is now allowed, the practicality of
                        doing so with my students while keeping them all safe, was not possible. So, I made a shift to
                        work on pre-vocational skills- which will be a topic covered in a later post. </p>
                    <p>However, I did have some students who LOVED cooking and with students being virtual either fully
                        or for parts of the week, I started recording myself reading visual recipes and encouraging my
                        students and parents to make the food at home if they wanted to. </p>
                    <h3 id="please-enter-teachers-pay-teachers">Please Enter Teachers Pay Teachers</h3>
                    <p>Of course that means I needed recipes– and with my population, I needed something with pictures.
                        So off to Teachers Pay Teachers I went (because at this point who has time to make something as
                        beautiful as what I can find on there...). One of my favorite go to shops there is <a
                            href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Breezy-Special-Ed?ref=mariaparks.com">Breezy
                            Special Ed</a>. She has <strong>SO</strong> many different resources and I especially loved
                        her visual recipes which I have used this school year. </p>
                    <h3 id="now-what">Now what?</h3>
                    <p>So, recipes in hand I needed to figure out a good way to give my students the instruction and
                        sustain engagement with them. I sat down and based on previous video experiences with virtual
                        learning I decided videos were the way to go. I knew I had to be in the video, doing actions to
                        help practice and retain information, and practicing language skills. So off to talk to my
                        computer like a crazy person I went... </p>
                    <h3 id="the-final-products">The final products</h3>
                    <p>The final products are 3-10 minute videos of myself reading the recipe of the week while doing
                        actions associated with the step and practicing language too. I do a new one each week, so these
                        playlists will keep growing. </p>
                    <p><strong>PLEASE USE THESE IF THEY ARE HELPFUL TO YOU!!!</strong> </p>
                    <p>There is no shame in using something someone else has made especially if it fits what you and
                        your students need. I found there was a gap in what I wanted and needed, so I just made the
                        videos myself, but I am hoping others can save some time/energy and use what I have done or at
                        least give them an idea of what they want to do (or not do...)! </p>

                                <p>My name is Maria Parks and I am a special education teacher in Wisconsin. I am
                                    looking to share some of what I do every day with others who might find it useful to
                                    use themselves with their students!</p>
