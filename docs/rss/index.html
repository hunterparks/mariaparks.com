It came up often in class and I will be the first one to tell you I was NOT sold on the idea. I tucked it in the back of my mind and thought &quot;yeah... <em>maybe</em> one day&quot;.</p><p><em>This year was my &quot;one day&quot; moment.</em></p><p>Let me back up. If you are unfamiliar with what a token economy is, the premise is that a student works for something, generally earning tokens (could be stars, coins, etc.) to earn something preferred (generally a break of their choice).</p><p>This is where <strong>work break </strong>comes in, too, which is part of the process. With my students, having sustained attention on a topic or task at hand can be very challenging. Breaking up the work over several shorter work sessions with breaks in between allows their brain to have a little rest before starting again. It also helps increase motivation as students know after they work they get a break; cue first/then language...</p><h3 id="using-first-then-language">Using first/then language</h3><p>I will admit, again, I was not always sold on the power of using those words with my students, but IT WORKS (parents out there you might find this helpful too!). Simply say to them &quot;first (task), then (break or preferred task)&quot;. It is a simple way to let your students know what the expectations are and what they have to do to obtain what they want.</p><p><em>Stick to it and follow though.</em></p><p>It is SO important they not only do the task (no caving in on your expectations of them), but you reward them with whatever the &quot;then&quot; part of your statement was. This builds trust and hopefully after time it will all come easier as they know what they have to do before they can have that break.</p><p><em>Stay strong. I know it is not always easy. Deep breaths.</em></p><h3 id="okay-back-to-token-economy-systems-">Okay, back to token economy systems!</h3><p>I like to use a simple chart that has a spot for 5 tokens and a spot for what they are working for. Simply put, the student completes a task, they earn a token, and after 5 they get a break for 5 minutes. Then, we start it all over again. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://mariaparks.com/content/images/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-10.03.40-AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Token Economy &amp; Work/Break Systems" loading="lazy" width="665" height="434" srcset="https://mariaparks.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-10.03.40-AM.png 600w, https://mariaparks.com/content/images/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-11-at-10.03.40-AM.png 665w"><figcaption>An example of the token boards I use with my students. I put a picture of the break choice they choose in the top box and they earn stars for completing the work. All 5 means they get the break!&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><p>This changed my life when I started using it with some of my students who struggled with completing work. They knew the expectations, it was consistent, and I finally was able to get them to do a work session with me that was longer than 1 minute long.</p><p>Now don&apos;t get me wrong, there is still some yelling/being upset when coming back from a break or when we first start. I am not sure that will ever go away completely, but a majority of the time it makes work sessions more enjoyable and productive for <em>everyone. </em></p><p>After time, you can increase the number of tokens (for one of my students we went from 5 to 10 recently!!) which increases the length of the work session, which is overall a good thing for everyone!</p><h3 id="how-can-you-get-started-with-this-you-ask">How can you get started with this you ask?</h3><p>You can find a copy of the token economy template I use, below. You will notice that you can customize the tokens to be something that is of high interest for your student. This will help increase engagement and interest in the system!</p><p>I also have a generic document I shared with people who were going to be using the system with students so that we were all doing it the same way and had the same expectations. Feel free to use and modify as you need!</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1588kPvzTnM7FqdhRjqEO39gPF5KnQMfaQcmg_XjVCHk/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=mariaparks.com">Token Economy Template</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_hzfyXYvOXI3YzRoy-IlJq-UhryqNn_6jTiQpq2bqwQ/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=mariaparks.com">Token Economy Directions for Staff</a></p><h3 id="other-general-tips-i-have-learned-along-the-way-">Other general tips I have learned along the way:</h3><ol><li><strong>Visibility: </strong>Have the visual, visible. I have the one I use with my student on the desk we do work at so she can see exactly how many tokens she has. She can also see me give the tokens as she completes the work.</li><li><strong>The Plan:</strong> Make sure everyone that works with the student is on the same page with the plan. Consistency is key. Keeping a routine and expectations the same is so important, especially when you are first starting.</li><li><strong>Tokens:</strong> Make the tokens something of high interest for the student&#x2013; this will increase engagement.</li><li><strong>High Interest Breaks: </strong>They should be working for something they actually want (more on this at the end but basically it HAS to be highly motivating to them otherwise why work for it?) Give them a menu of choices or have them pick it if they are able.</li><li><strong>Praise: </strong>However your student likes to receive praise is how you need to praise them as you start this. If you are excited about progress so are they. Maybe it&apos;s cheering, clapping, or singing. <em>Whatever it is, you better be the biggest cheerleader for your kid as they complete a task </em>(there is always a lot of cheering &amp; singing coming from my room!).</li><li><strong>Follow Though:</strong> It might take a long time for them to do the work (like a long time- you will know when to push and when they need to just chill before you try again) but make sure that they do it before they get that highly desired break. If you cave it will only be that much harder the next time as they think you will cave and give them what they want without doing the work.<strong> Stay strong. They can do it and so can you!</strong></li><li><strong>Reward:</strong> This goes hand it hand with #6, but make sure you give them the break they have earned right away after they have earned it, so they make the connection between doing the work and earning the break.</li><li><strong>Keep Practicing:</strong> After a break have them complete another work session. We like to use visual timers to show the kids how much time they have left on their break and help signal when it is time for work again.</li></ol><h3 id="break-choices">Break choices</h3><p>A quick note about break choices. Like I have mentioned it is important that it is something they REALLY want. This will help motivate them to do the work. Sometimes that is a fidget, video, game, and maybe, just maybe it is an iPad. I am internally cringing as I even type the iPad comment. </p><p>I say that because I was <strong>strongly opposed</strong> to giving my student an iPad for her break to watch videos. I realized this year that I needed to pick my battles and the battle I wanted to win was having her complete work. So, we used the iPad/videos as her break and I wouldn&apos;t go back. It is something SHE wanted, SHE enjoys, and SHE is motivated by. I get the work out of her and she earns the break.</p><p>I have come to see that it is okay, because at the end of the day she is getting what she needs and if we didn&apos;t use it we would not see the progress we do. Just keep that in mind as you have your kids pick their break choices. Sometimes it is a matter of thinking about the battles you want to win.</p><p>Hopefully if you have read to this point you are have one student in mind you think could benefit from this. It takes time to work, but trust me, IT WORKS!</p><p>-Maria</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/parksteaches?ref=mariaparks.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parksteaches/?ref=mariaparks.com">Instagram</a>, like my page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParksTeaches">Facebook</a>, &#xA0;and subscribe to my channel on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL7VdHtFXmxq4Lp7lqas1w?ref=mariaparks.com">YouTube</a> to keep up to date on new posts and videos!</p><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@allentaylorjr?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Allen Taylor</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA["I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-C-E do you know what that means?"]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Let&apos;s talk independence and especially independence of kids.

Who doesn&apos;t want all kids to grow up to be independent? But why is it so hard as adults to have students practice independence before we say &quot;okay go do it on your own now!&quot;. </p><p>I have been thinking about this a lot with my students lately as I think about vocational skills and what school or life looks like for them after they leave me. </p><h3 id="the-conclusion-i-came-to-they-are-way-too-dependent-on-me-"><em>The conclusion I came to? They are WAY too dependent on me. </em></h3><p></p><p>Who doesn&apos;t want to be needed, right? I sure like to feel needed, but at what point does that also mean I am<em> inhibiting my students from being able to learn how to be independent without me? </em></p><p>Still not very clear? No worries. The idea in my head was fuzzy for a long time until one day when I was taking my students to the next location they needed to go. I noticed they were a few paces behind me. I realized in that moment as I was looking back at them to make sure they were following me, that not very often (if at all) are they leading the way to where they need to go. They are <strong>ALWAYS</strong> following me. </p><p>So of course, in that moment, I changed what I was doing to see what would happen if the roles were reversed. </p><h3 id="what-would-they-do-if-i-told-them-the-location-and-had-them-walk-in-front-of-me-to-get-there"><em>What would they do if I told them the location and had them walk in front of me to get there?</em></h3><p></p><p>They. Just. Stood. There. </p><p>No amount of encouragement, pointing in the correct direction, or waiting them out led to them taking one step in any direction as long as I was behind them. As soon as I moved in front of them a few paces they happily moved with me. </p><p>Later that day I stopped and thought about it more. I realized that I have never put them in a true position to lead the way to a location, so of course they looked at me like a<strong> CRAZY </strong>person when I switched the roles on them. Simply put, <em>I was not putting them in a position to be independent, rather I was ensuring they would be dependent on me.</em></p><p>From that day on I decided that I would, as much as possible, have them lead the way and hope that along the way they would become comfortable with leading and in turn develop more independence skills.</p><p><em>*If walking in the hallway is something your kids have mastered, as you continue reading think about what area(s) they could be more independent in</em></p><h3 id="i-started-making-these-small-changes-">I started making these small changes: </h3><ol><li><strong>Verbally telling my students where we were going (even if it was the same thing every day).</strong> I hoped that eventually they would associate what I was saying with the location we arrived at. I then said the location name again when we arrived. </li><li><strong>Asked them which way we had to go to reach the new location.</strong> This helped me ensure that we were going to start off in the right direction and gave us a chance to practice directional language (left, right, straight, etc.). &#xA0;</li><li><strong>Had them walk in front of me. </strong>This is the <em>hardest</em> but most important aspect of this plan. I needed them to know it&apos;s safe to lead the way and that I am not far behind (it really is an exercise in trust). Eventually I hope they will feel confident enough to do it without me, but baby steps. </li></ol><p>That&apos;s it. OH, and<strong> LOADS </strong>of practice. This is not a skill that is going to come easily or fast, but I believe is SO important for our kids to learn and develop over time. <em>We are trying to change how they have been operating for a long period of time</em>- from a role of following to leading. </p><h3 id="additional-considerations-if-you-are-going-to-attempt-to-try-this-out-with-your-students-">Additional considerations if you are going to attempt to try this out with your students: </h3><ol><li><strong>Give yourself PLENTY of time to get from point A to point B if you want to kids to lead the way.</strong><em> </em>Chances are that they are going to stand there and stare at you like you have two heads the first couple of times you try this out.<strong> </strong>Be <em>persistent, give encouragement, and be patient</em> as your students attempt to understand what you are asking of them. </li><li><strong>Try to have this happen all day; authentic practice.</strong> Do you have a team that works with you and the kids? Get them in on the plan. The more practice across different people/locations the better. </li><li><strong>Fade your support as you see independence.</strong> Maybe you start of directly behind them, then a few steps behind, and then a few more, and eventually maybe you are at one end of the hallway as they walk down away from you, independently (and then you go cry happy tears in your classroom because you never thought this would happen). </li><li><strong>Buddy your kids up.</strong> Doing something scary is lessened with company. If you can, have two of your students walk together. I like to use the prompt &quot;walk with X&quot; to get them to go together.<em> </em></li></ol><p>This seems so simple to me now, that I have often thought&#x2013; was I literally the last one to make this connection?! If you are reading this and thinking that I can tell you, you are<strong> NOT</strong> alone. </p><p>I find it is so easy to be wrapped up in the daily routines and hustle and bustle of the day - getting from point A to point B that something simple like this can get lost in it all. </p><h3 id="so-i-challenge-you-tell-your-kids-where-you-all-need-to-go-and-have-them-lead-you-there-see-what-they-do-">SO, I challenge you tell your kids where you all need to go and have them lead you there. See what they do.</h3><p>Can they navigate the building? Get you there a different way if not the way you always take them? Just look at you? </p><p><em>And if kids walking in the hallway isn&apos;t where your kids need to practice independence&#x2013; what else can you work on? </em><strong>How can you increase student independence and lessen the dependence they have on you?</strong></p><p>-Maria</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/parksteaches?ref=mariaparks.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parksteaches/?ref=mariaparks.com">Instagram</a> , like my page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParksTeaches">Facebook</a>, &#xA0;and subscribe to my channel on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL7VdHtFXmxq4Lp7lqas1w?ref=mariaparks.com">YouTube</a> to keep up to date on new posts and videos!</p><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@notethanun?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">note thanun</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA["Serving" up Life Skills (Pre-Vocational Skills)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h3 id="first-what-are-pre-vocational-skills">First, what are pre-vocational skills? </h3><p>To my understanding, pre-vocational skills are the skills that kids/people develop before going into vocational training or experiences.

Did it take a lot of time and was it a mess most of the time? </p><p>YES. </p><p>But, that was half of the fun! I will tell you the level of engagement of my kids <strong>SKYROCKETED</strong> when we were cooking. I had kids sitting at a table for extended periods of time with laser focus on the task at hand which was a <strong>BIG</strong> deal for some of my kids. </p><p>And, more importantly the kids were learning and practicing skills that might mean the difference between <em>being able to make meals for themselves or depending on someone else to help them. &#xA0;</em></p><h2 id="stop-">STOP. </h2><p></p><p>Think about that... I had this realization earlier this year and it made me re-think a lot of what I do because the things you work on now, can <em>impact the quality of life that students may have long after they leave you. </em></p><p>SO... cooking it is! We had a toaster oven donated to us from a teacher who was getting rid of one and we had a microwave in our room. The kids (and parents) helped brainstorm foods that the kids liked to eat and we rotated through them. </p><h3 id="now-cooking-during-covid-">Now... Cooking During COVID...</h3><p>Unfortunately, is nonexistent. While cooking in my building is now allowed, the practicality of doing so with my students while keeping them all safe, was not possible. So, I made a shift to work on pre-vocational skills- which will be a topic covered in a later post. </p><p>However, I did have some students who LOVED cooking and with students being virtual either fully or for parts of the week, I started recording myself reading visual recipes and encouraging my students and parents to make the food at home if they wanted to. </p><h3 id="please-enter-teachers-pay-teachers">Please Enter Teachers Pay Teachers</h3><p>Of course that means I needed recipes&#x2013; and with my population, I needed something with pictures. So off to Teachers Pay Teachers I went (because at this point who has time to make something as beautiful as what I can find on there...). One of my favorite go to shops there is <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Breezy-Special-Ed?ref=mariaparks.com">Breezy Special Ed</a>. She has <strong>SO</strong> many different resources and I especially loved her visual recipes which I have used this school year. </p><h3 id="now-what">Now what?</h3><p>So, recipes in hand I needed to figure out a good way to give my students the instruction and sustain engagement with them. I sat down and based on previous video experiences with virtual learning I decided videos were the way to go. I knew I had to be in the video, doing actions to help practice and retain information, and practicing language skills. So off to talk to my computer like a crazy person I went... </p><h3 id="the-final-products">The final products</h3><p>The final products are 3-10 minute videos of myself reading the recipe of the week while doing actions associated with the step and practicing language too. I do a new one each week, so these playlists will keep growing. </p><p><strong>PLEASE USE THESE IF THEY ARE HELPFUL TO YOU!!!</strong> </p><p>There is no shame in using something someone else has made especially if it fits what you and your students need. I found there was a gap in what I wanted and needed, so I just made the videos myself, but I am hoping others can save some time/energy and use what I have done or at least give them an idea of what they want to do (or not do...)! </p><p>Visit <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Store/Breezy-Special-Ed/Search:recipe?ref=mariaparks.com">Breezy Special Ed&apos;s TPT page </a>to get your hard copies for your students, and you can find the videos I have made to go along with some of the recipes (still working my way through what I have bought so far) below! </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL7VdHtFXmxq4Lp7lqas1w?ref=mariaparks.com">ParksTeaches YouTube Channel </a>(where you can find all of the videos I have so far)</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEO5t3sOuSJU4R5qsfYMFcnAeiSOQgJjN&amp;ref=mariaparks.com">Breakfast Recipes </a>Playlist </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEO5t3sOuSJW5hLxK-MyCez74Z7lX7Ghh&amp;ref=mariaparks.com">Main Dishes</a> Playlist</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEO5t3sOuSJXMGUWRcfhu0xRlAzGqogeT&amp;ref=mariaparks.com">Dessert Recipes</a> Playlist </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEO5t3sOuSJWhDnbhIy3yCQYz_P9I0EeI&amp;ref=mariaparks.com">Thanksgiving Recipes </a>Playlist </p><h3 id="keep-calm-and-cook-on">Keep calm and cook on</h3><p>I&apos;ll leave you with this: </p><ol><li>Consider cooking in your classroom. </li><li>Consider engaging your families in cooking at home. </li><li>You never know what kind of an impact cooking skills might have on students after they leave you. </li><li>Start off <em>small</em> and enjoy &amp; embrace the <strong>mess</strong>! </li></ol><p>-Maria </p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/parksteaches?ref=mariaparks.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parksteaches/?ref=mariaparks.com">Instagram</a> , like my page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParksTeaches">Facebook</a>, &#xA0;and subscribe to my channel on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL7VdHtFXmxq4Lp7lqas1w?ref=mariaparks.com">YouTube</a> to keep up to date on new posts and videos!</p><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brookelark?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Brooke Lark</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meet Maria Parks & What this is ALL About.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="who-is-this-lady">Who is this lady? </h2><p>Hello!

I am a special education teacher in Wisconsin. I have been blogging my journey in education on and off since I graduated from college (go UW-Whitewater!) in 2018. I wanted to take another, more serious stab, at it as the passion for what I am doing now, grows by the day. </p><p>If you told me 3 years ago that I was going to be teaching: literacy, math, life skills, and the occasional self contained elective, social studies, and science classes&#x2013; I probably would have laughed out of pure incredulousness. But, alas, here we are. </p><h3 id="how-do-myself-and-many-other-teachers-do-it">How do myself and many other teachers do it? </h3><p>We get really good at learning from other teachers in our building and online. We become masterful at finding free resources online, Teacher Pay Teachers becomes a go to resource, and we do not stop until we find what will help our students learn what they need to know. </p><p>So, I figure I can do a small part and share to the teaching community a bit about what I am doing in my classroom. Maybe someone out there will be able to use what I have created; which is mostly videos at this point (I am a self proclaimed You-Tuber since the pandemic and virtual learning hit). </p><p>I <strong>KNOW</strong> it feels like most days we do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> have enough time to get everything done in a day&#x2013; so if someone else can benefit from what I have done, then why not share. </p><h3 id="what-my-videos-are-and-are-not-">What my videos are... and are not... </h3><p>By no means are my videos perfect. Do I mess up? Do I say &quot;ummm&quot; and &quot;ope&quot; sometimes? Do I have the most ridiculous facial expressions <strong><em>MOST</em></strong> times? </p><p>YES. </p><p>YES. </p><p>and YES. </p><p>Just like everyone else in the world I am working on my craft and getting better by the day. Take them or leave them for what they are. </p><h3 id="where-my-passion-lies">Where my passion lies</h3><p>Right now, my passion lies in life skills and pre-vocational skills. I think these are two of the <strong><em>MOST</em></strong> important skills for the students I work with. I am having a plethora of fun learning about these areas. You will see for now, my content is going to focus on these areas. It is something that makes me happy, and who doesn&apos;t need a bright spot in these WEIRD pandemic times we are in. </p><h3 id="let-s-review-">Let&apos;s review...</h3><ol><li>My name is Maria. </li><li>I am a special education teacher who is passionate about student success, life skills, and pre- vocational skills. </li><li>I want to share what I am doing in hopes that others find it useful and can use it with their students without having to re-create the wheel. </li><li> I want to help- help <em><strong>all</strong></em> people succeed. </li></ol><p>Thats it in a nutshell. Come along and learn with me&#x2013; I am by no means an expert, but I am looking forward to sharing what I know and continue learning with the teaching community. </p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/parksteaches?ref=mariaparks.com">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parksteaches/?ref=mariaparks.com">Instagram</a> , like my page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ParksTeaches">Facebook</a>, &#xA0;and subscribe to my channel on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSL7VdHtFXmxq4Lp7lqas1w?ref=mariaparks.com">YouTube</a> to keep up to date on new posts and videos!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
